# Smart Stack - AI-Powered Credit Card Personalization Platform

A comprehensive 6-layer real-time personalization engine that transforms generic credit card offers into hyper-personalized experiences through advanced machine learning and streaming analytics.

## Overview

Smart Stack addresses the challenge of irrelevant financial offers by implementing a sophisticated ML pipeline that processes user behavior, spending patterns, and preferences to deliver personalized credit card offers in real-time with sub-100ms response times.

## The Problem

- Generic Offers: One-size-fits-all credit card offers with low conversion rates
- Lack of Feedback Loops: Systems that don't learn from user interactions  
- Slow, Non-Adaptive UX: Static interfaces that don't update based on user behavior

## Solution Architecture

### 6-Layer Pipeline

1. Data Ingestion
   - Google Analytics + Kafka event streaming
   - Captures user interactions across all channels
   - Real-time behavioral data collection

2. Feature Engineering  
   - dbt + Spark processing with BigQuery/Redshift
   - Transforms raw data into ML-ready features
   - Spend trends, category preferences, reward vs discount focus

3. ML Model
   - XGBoost offer scoring with SmartScore fallback rules
   - Ranks offers using spending patterns and quiz responses
   - Real-time inference with cached results

4. AI Messaging
   - GPT/Gemini-powered personalized explanations
   - Generates context like "You spent 3x more on coffee shops..."
   - Builds user trust through transparency

5. Application Layer
   - Firebase/Redis engagement tracking
   - Manages streaks, badges, and achievement systems
   - Gamification elements for user retention

6. Feedback Loop
   - React frontend with Cloudflare optimization
   - Collects clicks, ratings, and user interactions
   - Routes feedback back to model retraining

## Tech Stack

- ML Framework: XGBoost, scikit-learn, Vertex AI
- Streaming: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark  
- Data Storage: BigQuery, Redshift, S3/GCS, Vertex AI Feature Store
- Backend: FastAPI, Redis, Firebase
- Frontend: React, Cloudflare
- LLM Integration: OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini
- Monitoring: Datadog, Looker
- Infrastructure: AWS/GCP, Docker, Kubernetes

## Model Selection

XGBoost was chosen over LightGBM and CatBoost because it provides:
- High accuracy with structured tabular data
- Fast real-time prediction speed
- Excellent handling of missing and skewed data
- Interpretable results via feature importance
- Best balance for production scalability

## Key Features

- Real-time personalization with sub-100ms response times
- LLM-generated transparent offer explanations
- Crisis-resilient design with smart caching (98% uptime maintained)
- Privacy-first architecture with GDPR compliance
- Automated PII redaction and consent-based data collection
- Cross-functional team workflow integration

## Customer Journey Example

Sara, a 34-year-old Amex Gold member, typically spends on dining but shows interest in travel offers. Smart Stack detects this behavioral shift through:
- Real-time Kafka streaming of spending patterns
- XGBoost dynamic offer re-ranking
- LLM-generated questions about new preferences
- Continuous model refinement through feedback loops

## Performance Metrics

- Response Time: Under 100ms real-time offer delivery
- System Uptime: 98% maintained during crisis scenarios  
- Model Accuracy: 80%+ prediction accuracy with continuous learning
- Business Impact: 30-80% improvements across satisfaction, conversion, and revenue metrics
- User Trust: 4.2+/5 ratings for AI explanations

## Launch Strategy

4-Phase implementation with $350K total budget:

Phase 1: Development (5 weeks, $200K-$220K)
- Define personalization logic and build XGBoost scoring engine
- Set up Kafka, Google Analytics, BigQuery infrastructure
- Design quiz questions and fallback logic

Phase 2: Testing (2 weeks, $50K-$57K)  
- Launch to 10% users in shadow mode
- Track quiz responses and offer interactions
- Ensure privacy compliance and bug fixes

Phase 3: Deployment (3 weeks, $71K-$92K)
- Roll out to all customers with monitoring
- Enable monthly quiz refresh and badge systems
- Monitor clicks, skips, and engagement metrics

Phase 4: Stabilization (4+ weeks, ongoing)
- Weekly model retraining with live data
